## Introduction

Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used to discover associations between products that customers tend to buy together. This code provides tools to perform market basket analysis on transaction data and extract valuable insights.

## Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (you can install these via pip):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - mlxtend (for association rule mining)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com//market-basket-insights.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd market-basket-insights
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Place your transaction data file in the `data` directory.

2. Modify the configuration in `config.py` if necessary (e.g., specify input file and analysis parameters).

3. Run the main analysis script:
   ```bash
   python market_basket_analysis.py
   ```

4. The results will be generated and stored in the `results` directory.

## Data

Explain the format and source of the transaction data. Provide any data preprocessing steps if applicable.

## Analysis

Explain the analysis techniques and methods used, such as association rule mining (e.g., Apriori algorithm) and any custom analysis you've implemented.

## Results

Describe the insights obtained from the analysis, including association rules, support, confidence, and lift values.

## Introduction

Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used to discover associations between products that customers tend to buy together. This code provides tools to perform market basket analysis on transaction data and extract valuable insights.

## Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (you can install these via pip):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - mlxtend (for association rule mining)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muthuabi28104/market-basket-insights.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd market-basket-insights
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Place your transaction data file in the `data` directory.

2. Modify the configuration in `config.py` if necessary (e.g., specify input file and analysis parameters).

3. Run the main analysis script:
   ```bash
   python market_basket_analysis.py
   ```

4. The results will be generated and stored in the `results` directory.

## Data

Explain the format and source of the transaction data. Provide any data preprocessing steps if applicable.

## Analysis

Explain the analysis techniques and methods used, such as association rule mining (e.g., Apriori algorithm) and any custom analysis you've implemented.

## Results

Describe the insights obtained from the analysis, including association rules, support, confidence, and lift values.

## Data

### Dataset Source
The dataset used for this Market Basket Insights analysis was sourced from [Source Name]. You can find the original dataset at [Dataset URL] or [Data Provider's Website].

# data set link :(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis)

### Description
The dataset contains transaction data from [Description of Data Source]. Each row in the dataset represents a single transaction, and the columns include information such as:

- `TransactionID`: A unique identifier for each transaction.
- `ProductID`: A unique identifier for each product purchased.
- `ProductName`: The name or description of the product.
- `Quantity`: The quantity of each product purchased in the transaction.

The dataset was collected during the period of [Collection Period], and it contains [Number of Transactions] transactions and [Number of Products] unique products.

Before using this dataset for Market Basket Analysis, it may be necessary to preprocess it, handle missing values, and format it to be compatible with the analysis code in this repository.

Please ensure that you have the required dataset in the appropriate format and location as specified in the configuration (`config.py`) before running the analysis code.

Feel free to provide more specific details about the dataset, its origin, and any data preprocessing steps required for your particular analysis.
